## Assignment 5

Implement the K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm in numpy.

You can use the iris dataset for this.

It already exists within scikit-learn. You can import it from sklearn.datasets 

Follow previous conventions for sending PRs.


## Assignment 6

Now that you've implemented Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and KNN all by yourself, use scikit-learn's inbuilt functions to run these algorithms on the same data and compare the accuracies.

The accuracies you get through scikit-learn might be better than your own, this is expected since scikit implements a lot of optimizations internally.

Try to read up about Cross Validation and how it can help set the hyperparameters to improve test set accuracy.
