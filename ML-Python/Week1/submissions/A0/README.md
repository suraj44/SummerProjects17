# Guidelines

1. Rename your Ipython Notebooks as A0_yourname.ipynb and add them to this folder

2. Commit and push to your local fork

3. Create a pull request

4. Make sure you've done `git pull upstream master` before you push.

5. Do not mess with others submissions. View them and if you wish to edit something do it by copying it elsewhere.

6. To avoid hassles, add your files here only once you've finalised onyour submission.
