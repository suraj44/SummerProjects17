Note: Guidelines for submissions are in the README.md files in the respective folders in /ML-Python/Session-0/Submissions

A0. Install Anaconda. Run the Ipython Notebook. Submit your first Ipython Notebook.

A1. Read up on Python lists and Dictionaries. (No Submissions)

A2. Histogram. Write a Python Program that takes in a list of integers and displays the corresponding histogram provided the binsize(Interval Width)

Input: 
1. List of integers
2. Bin Size

Output:
1. Histogram

Guidelines:

Keep your code as modular as possible. Everything should be within functions.

Additional points if you are able to store and return the data represented in the histogram. For e.g if the user wants, at a later stage in the program he should be able to view the list of values that made up the second bin in the histogram.

Expected ouput for bin sizes of 2, 10, 3 are displayed the A2_Soln.jpg
