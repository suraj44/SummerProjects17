ckbs : <@U55UC8R09|ckbs> has joined the channel

kenichi : <@U56H3SYJG|kenichi> has joined the channel

salman-bhai : HI guys!

salman-bhai : There are just 5 of you! We'll wait for five more minutes!

anumeha29 : Okay

rosag31 : Alright

salman-bhai : P.S. You can head over to the random channel if you want to ask anything else apart from the Summer Project. :stuck_out_tongue:

salman-bhai : Alright hello!

salman-bhai : And welcome to the first session of IEEE Summer Project for DBMS and CC

salman-bhai : We're the first summer project to start this early!

salman-bhai : :stuck_out_tongue:

salman-bhai : Okay so before we start, I'll tell you a brief overview of what we'll be doing for today!

salman-bhai : Are u guys online?

anumeha29 : yes

salman-bhai : <@U56JCBFA9> <@U579Y5A7Q> <@U56DHFD99>

rosag31 : :+1:

ckbs : yes

nachiket : yes

salman-bhai : Haa cool cool!

priyam : Yes!

salman-bhai : Don't sleep in between :stuck_out_tongue:

hrily : Aye

salman-bhai : Okay so who all over here know Java

nachiket : me

rosag31 : me

salman-bhai : We'll try to make this as interactive as possible!

hlpr98 : Me

salman-bhai : Awesome okay so <@U55UB6X9P> tell me what is the difference between an Object Oriented and an Imperative language like C

salman-bhai : Which you studied this semester

nachiket : In OOP we can deal with real world problems easily..

nachiket : better than Procedural lang like c

ram_aditya : <@U55UE0J9F|ram_aditya> has joined the channel

salman-bhai : Okay why is that?

nachiket : We can use objects(analogous to people or real objects in world) , give them characteristics and work...

salman-bhai : <@U56DHFD99> can you tell me by that time what is a class and an object? What is the difference between the two?

salman-bhai : Waiting .... :stuck_out_tongue:

rosag31 : ok. So a class is an interface which encapsulates all the data members and member functions. An object is the specific instance of a class

bhavishya : <@U55UDASSV|bhavishya> has joined the channel

salman-bhai : OKay too many concepts there in one line!

salman-bhai : Alright so let me break it down very simply

rosag31 : :joy:

salman-bhai : There are 4 types of Programming languages paradigms that you need to know:

salman-bhai : 1. Procedural Languages

salman-bhai : 2. Object Oriented Languages

salman-bhai : 3. Functional Languages

salman-bhai : 4. Logical Languages

salman-bhai : 1. *Procedural* An example would be C. A simple procedure is defined and everything is defined sequentially!

salman-bhai : 2. *Object Oriented* Code is modelled in terms of real-life objects

salman-bhai : For example take the example of a College!

vilas : <@U531L233L|vilas> has joined the channel

salman-bhai : A college has data types like number of students, professors, etc.

salman-bhai : I'll talk about this in sometime!

salman-bhai : 3. Functional Programming : These are modelled in terms of mathematical functions! You can ask the guys in the Erlang SUmmer Project about them!

hrily : data-members, If I'm correct

salman-bhai : 4. Logical: We'll be doing this with sql

ishaan : <@U57A20DSS|ishaan> has joined the channel

salman-bhai : Data Members** Thank you <@U530UCFTL>

salman-bhai : Alright so you guys will be learning Object Oriented Programming Language called Java today!

salman-bhai : I'll send you links for Java Hardware, how the compilation process and all take place in Java

salman-bhai : Okay now <@U579Y5A7Q> do you remember if-else loops in C/C++?

hlpr98 : Yes

salman-bhai : Alright type it out!

salman-bhai : If x &gt; 1 -&gt; Print Yes

salman-bhai : Else if x &lt; 1 -&gt; print no

salman-bhai : else print -&gt; error

salman-bhai : Type the code for this!

hlpr98 : If(x&gt;1)
Print("Yes");
Else if(x&lt;1)
Print("No");
Else
Print("error");


salman-bhai : Cool!

salman-bhai : So similarly we have the exact same syntax for while, do-while, for loops as well

salman-bhai : ```
If(x&gt;1)Print("Yes");
Else if(x&lt;1)Print("No");ElsePrint("error");

salman-bhai : ```
If(x&gt;1) 
  Print("Yes");
Else if(x&lt;1) 
  Print("No");
Else
  Print("error");
```

salman-bhai : A more appropriate way to write it down

salman-bhai : Make sure you don't miss indentations!

ishaan : Yeah

salman-bhai : Alright 
<https://www.javatpoint.com/java-if-else>

salman-bhai : This website has a brief introduction on Control Statements in Java!

salman-bhai : Make sure you read stuff from here!

salman-bhai : It might help you guys during your Assignment!

salman-bhai : ANy questions till now?

anumeha29 : nope

ckbs : no

hlpr98 : no

bhavishya : nope

rosag31 : Nope

nachiket : no

ishaan : nope

priyam : No!

ram_aditya : nope

salman-bhai : Alright so let's start Java now! :stuck_out_tongue: 
Properly!

ishaan : okay

salman-bhai : So Java is a pretty significant Language when it comes to the Industry today!

salman-bhai : If you look majority of the projects are often done on Java! This is more because it's become a standard to use Java for each and every purpose!!

salman-bhai : Java is bult on top of C, thus compiled Java code runs slower than C!

salman-bhai : The compilation process for Java is something like this!

salman-bhai : First, you compile code using ```javac filename.java```

salman-bhai : Later you can run the Java code using ```java filename```

salman-bhai : This basically runs the Java code!

ishaan : okay!

anumeha29 : okay

salman-bhai : Now a majority of Java code is written using IDEs

ckbs : ok

salman-bhai : There a couple of them that are available that I suggest you can use!

salman-bhai : 1. Eclipse: Sleek and fast but installation is a headache :stuck_out_tongue:
2. Netbeans: Looks bad, but very easy to install!

salman-bhai : You can find it for whatever Operating System that you are using! Just google :stuck_out_tongue:

salman-bhai : Okay before we move on, <@U57A20DSS> what is an IDE?

ishaan : Integrated development environment

salman-bhai : Which means...? :stuck_out_tongue:

ishaan : it is a place where one can write and compile codes.. if I'm correct

salman-bhai : Yes, there is something called as a TextEditor! <@U56JCBFA9> what is the difference between a text editor and a IDE?

anumeha29 : An IDE also consists of debugger and automation tools , while in a text editor you just write your lines of code

salman-bhai : Awesome!

salman-bhai : Text Editors contain automation tools as well as long as you don't use Notepad

salman-bhai : Sublime Text is an amazing TextEditor

salman-bhai : There's something called as vim as well in text editor though I prefer EMACS. That's better! :stuck_out_tongue:

salman-bhai : <@U530UCFTL> prefers vim :smile:

salman-bhai : OKay any questions guys till now?

rithesh : <@U55UJ9MH7|rithesh> has joined the channel

ckbs : but, vim also has the gdb right?

priyam : Is there any major reason why java is preferred over c++ ?

salman-bhai : After this we'll be talking about:
1. Classes and Objects
2. Data Members and Methods

1. Inheritance
2. Overriding
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
5. Encapsulation
6. Packages

ishaan : okay

salman-bhai : <@U55UC8R09> you can integrate gdb in vim

ckbs : oh, okay

salman-bhai : <https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/2046/how-can-i-integrate-gdb-with-vim>

salman-bhai : <@U530UCFTL> can help you more out with this:p

salman-bhai : <@U57AA2TEK> I'll come to that by the end of this session!

salman-bhai : Or possibly the next ssession!

salman-bhai : You need to know more concepts for that !

priyam : Cool!

salman-bhai : OKay so before I move with OOP Concepts one last point is primitive data types

salman-bhai : There are 8 *Primitive Data Types* in Java:
1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. float
6. double
7. boolean
8. char

salman-bhai : <http://cs.fit.edu/~ryan/java/language/java-data.html>

salman-bhai : In case you want to know more about it!

salman-bhai : Any questions, anyone?

salman-bhai : Yes/ No?

ckbs : no

anumeha29 : no

nachiket : no

ishaan : no

priyam : Nopes :stuck_out_tongue:

ram_aditya : No

rosag31 : no

rithesh : no

salman-bhai : Alright!

salman-bhai : So lets start with class in Java

bhavishya : no

salman-bhai : So Java unlike C++ is a pure Object Oriented Language. Everything in Java is a class!

salman-bhai : If you remember doing the Hello World program in Java you had to write a public class first which was the name of your file!

salman-bhai : Similarly, each and every file in Java exists in the form of a class!

ishaan : yeah

salman-bhai : Each class in itself has a Class Data Member and a Class Method

salman-bhai : A simple example would be something like this:

salman-bhai : Hold on

salman-bhai : I can't find a nice example: I'll type it out.

ishaan : ok

anumeha29 : okay

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F57AJTUCF/dog_java.java|Dog.java> and commented: Yeah check this out!

salman-bhai : Okay so in this file Dog is out class!

salman-bhai : <@U56DHFD99> can you tell me the methods and Data Members in this file?

rosag31 : the data members are breed, ageC and color.

rosag31 : barking(), hungry() and sleeping() are the methods.

salman-bhai : Awesome so basically methods are the equivalent of a function that you learnt this year!

salman-bhai : Data Members are basic variables that you learnt

rosag31 : Yup

ishaan : Yeah

salman-bhai : Okay now we'll learn objects

anumeha29 : ok

ckbs : ok

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F57AKM4J3/-.java|Untitled> and commented: CAn anyone tell me what _dog_ is called?

ishaan : object of class Dog

salman-bhai : Exactly an object is an instance of a class!

salman-bhai : A simple analogy would be let's say you know how to make a pen! You will use the same data members use in the procedure for making that pen but keep on giving different names for each of the pens!

salman-bhai : Like a Cello Pen would have the same method as Reynolds pen

salman-bhai : But they have different names

salman-bhai : SImilarly different types of dogs would have different characteristics

salman-bhai : But all of that can be stored in a variable!
As in this example it is age, colour, breed!

salman-bhai : Any doubts people!

ishaan : nope

bhavishya : no

nachiket : no

ckbs : no

anumeha29 : no

priyam : No!

rithesh : nope

rosag31 : nope

ram_aditya : nope

salman-bhai : If not, take a 5 minute break!

ishaan : cool

salman-bhai : Also, I'm hoping you guys are taking notes :stuck_out_tongue:

anumeha29 : yep

salman-bhai : You'll forget all of this else!

salman-bhai : If you guys aren't one of you can create a thread on the Google group and upload photos. :smile:

salman-bhai : We'll start at 8.25

ishaan : yeah, someone please do it :stuck_out_tongue::sweat_smile:

salman-bhai : I'll take half an hour more and then we'll wrap up for today!

ishaan : cool

salman-bhai : OK, so before we start I want to talk 5 minutes about the assignment!

salman-bhai : The Assignment deadline is on Next friday

salman-bhai : I hope that's fine for everyone!

anumeha29 : yeahh

salman-bhai : ?*

ishaan : yeah

bhavishya : yep

rosag31 : yup

nachiket : yeah

ckbs : fine

ram_aditya : yup

hlpr98 : yes

priyam : yep

salman-bhai : Your task would be to create a Student Record program

salman-bhai : <http://agilemodeling.com/images/models/classDiagramInheritance.jpg>

salman-bhai : It'll be having four classes as shown above

salman-bhai : The upper column is Data Members and the lower column is methods

ishaan : okay!

salman-bhai : You have to read data from a CSV file.

salman-bhai : So right now, I'll be teaching:
1. Inheritance
2. File Reading
3. Basic Program Structure

anumeha29 : okay

salman-bhai : The image is just an example. You don't have to do that!

salman-bhai : <@U530UCFTL> is writing that assignment for you :stuck_out_tongue: Be Prepared :stuck_out_tongue:

salman-bhai : Alright any doubts with reagrds to the assignment?

salman-bhai : Also we'll be sending a detailed problem statement and I'll try to make a Class Diagram and send it for you guys as well!

anumeha29 : cool

ishaan : okay

ckbs : ok

priyam : Sounds good

salman-bhai : Awesome!

rosag31 : ok!

salman-bhai : Okay so Inheriatnce

salman-bhai : Inheritance**

ishaan : Yeah

salman-bhai : &gt;Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the 
properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance 
the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.
&gt;-Tutorials Point

salman-bhai : Basically the idea is assume there are two classes: *Parent* and *Child*

salman-bhai : Now the Child will have the characteristics of the parent and some of its own!

salman-bhai : The characteristics of the parent are said to be *inherited*

salman-bhai : So let's say if I have a method called isMale() defined in a parent class, the same method does not need to be defined again in the child class!

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F57AP88TZ/inherit_java.java|inherit.java> and commented: A simple example of Java inheritance!

salman-bhai : In Java, the keyword extends is used to write an inheritance relationship

ishaan : oh, okay!

salman-bhai : Take a look at this example!

salman-bhai : OKay wait, who hasn't answered any question till now!

salman-bhai : Who haven't I asked anything?

priyam : Me!

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F55RSN08G/-.java|Untitled>

ram_aditya :  Me

salman-bhai : Alright <@U57AA2TEK> tell me how many classes and objects are there in this snippet that I added?

salman-bhai : <@U55UE0J9F> tell me how many methods and how many data members are there in that code snippet

priyam : 1 parent class  Calculation, 1 child class My_Calculation,

salman-bhai : Objects?

priyam : 2 objects addition and multiplication?

salman-bhai : Umm no!

salman-bhai : <@U56DHFD99> can you help <@U57AA2TEK> ?

ram_aditya : 1 data memebr
and 2 methods in total

ram_aditya : But  im confused

salman-bhai : <@U55UE0J9F> names

salman-bhai : ?

salman-bhai : OKay what are you confused about?

rosag31 : yeah sure.. There is only one object - demo

ram_aditya : Does the data member declared for  the function argument a data member? 

ram_aditya : Is the*

priyam : oh wait only 1

priyam : my bad

rosag31 : the basic syntax to identify an object is:

rosag31 : class_name object_name = new class_name(parameters if any);

priyam : Yea got it!

rosag31 : Cool

salman-bhai : OKay so is everyone clear about this?

ckbs : yeah

ram_aditya : I had a doubt.


salman-bhai : <@U56DHFD99> good work

salman-bhai : Yes <@U55UE0J9F>

salman-bhai : That doesn't account for it!

ram_aditya : about whether the variable declared for  the function argument is a  data member or not?

ram_aditya : Oh cool

ram_aditya : Thanks

ishaan : Cool

salman-bhai : You'll know about it when we learn about types of variables!

anumeha29 : cool

salman-bhai : OKay so have you guys done File I/O in C?

ishaan : Yes

ram_aditya : Yes

salman-bhai : Well we're going to implement something similar for your assignment

salman-bhai : Does anyone know what is a CSV file?

salman-bhai : If anyone has done any Machine Learning they'd probably know about this!

ishaan : Umm no :no_mouth:

salman-bhai : <@U55UE0J9F> <@U56JCBFA9> <@U56DHFD99> <@U57AA2TEK> <@U55UDASSV> anyone?

salman-bhai : <@U56H3SYJG> ?

anumeha29 : nopee

rosag31 : nope

hrily : Some detail about data members and functions
+ Data members are properties of the object 
   Eg:  Color of a BMW car, Here BMW is object of class Car, and color is it's  property/data-member
+ Data-function are methods which the object carries out
   Eg: Start Ignition of BMW car, here startIgnition() is method/data-fuction

ram_aditya : Well I havent done any machine learning..
But is it same as the file we get to download for goofle forms?

hrily : <@U55UE0J9F> 
I hope you get answet to your question

priyam : comma separated values file. we got an introduction to it in python

ram_aditya : <@U530UCFTL> Thank You!

salman-bhai : <@U55UE0J9F> Yes!

salman-bhai : <@U57AA2TEK> Is right!

salman-bhai : Basically it's something like this!

salman-bhai : Lets say we have two columns in a CSV file

salman-bhai : In an excel spreadsheet**

salman-bhai : Now the problem with an Excel Spreadsheet is it isn't readable everywhere! You need to separate columns properly

salman-bhai : So take a look at the following example!

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F56G3SNP4/names_csv.txt|names.csv>

salman-bhai : Now if this same file is opened in an Excel Sheet it will show two columns One for Names and One for AGe

ishaan : ohh, okay...

salman-bhai : And the list of names and Age will be separated accordingly!

salman-bhai : For your assignment you've been given a CSV file to write

salman-bhai : Read**

anumeha29 : okk

salman-bhai : <https://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-read-and-parse-csv-file-in-java/>

salman-bhai : Good resource to read! :stuck_out_tongue:

ishaan : Thanks!

salman-bhai : There's not much theory behind this!

salman-bhai : You just have to read and write to CSV files

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F56DZJMDZ/general_java_file_structure.php|General Java file structure> and commented: This is the general structure in a Java file

salman-bhai : Okay that's it for today!

salman-bhai : Before you guys ask any doubts Hrishi will tell you about the assignment

salman-bhai : <https://sites.google.com/view/ieee-sp-dbms-cc/assignments/assignment-1>

salman-bhai : The problem statement can be found here

salman-bhai : <@U530UCFTL> over to you! :stuck_out_tongue:

hrily : Thank you <@U52A977UG>

ishaan : uh, it says the deadline is 5th April :sweat_smile:

hrily : The problem statement is well explained
If you have any queries, please ask

hrily : Okay will change that <@U57A20DSS>

salman-bhai : <@U57A20DSS> that's next Friday :stuck_out_tongue:

salman-bhai : According to Hrishi

salman-bhai : :stuck_out_tongue:

ishaan : Yeah. Got it!

salman-bhai : 5th May**

salman-bhai : Alright you guys can ask any doubts!

anumeha29 : yeah cool

salman-bhai : I'll be online for 10 more minutes here! 
Else you can ping me on the WhatsApp group as well!

hrily : Regarding submission:
You will need to upload your programs on DBMS repo on github
The instructions are on below the problem statements

ram_aditya : Could you clarify on using the main function within the class?

hrily : main() is the entry point of your class
just like main() is entry point of any c program

hrily : whenever you execute any java compiled class by
```
java classname
```
the first function called is main()

hrily : hope you get ir

hrily : it*

ram_aditya : Then shouldnt main be in an object and not a class?

salman-bhai : An object is created via the main

hrily : Again to  the basics
class is definition
and
object is an instance

we can't define calass

hrily : class*

hrily : object**

salman-bhai : Yeah <@U530UCFTL> better explained :smile:

hrily : we can't define object*

ckbs : Also, in some of the examples the arguments to the main function was (String []args) and in some other programs it was (String args[]).....is there any difference between the two?

hrily : nice questions <@U55UC8R09>

ram_aditya : <@U52A977UG> <@U530UCFTL> 
Thank You!

salman-bhai : <@U55UC8R09> Good noticing skills :stuck_out_tongue:

hrily : in java 
array can be declared in two ways
```
int[] arr;
```

```
int arr[];
```

both are one and the same

ckbs : oh ok,thanks

nachiket : Is there any way to inherit only a few characteristics instead of all from a parent class?

hrily : Again a good question

hrily : we'll cover that in next session

hrily : when we'll be talking about Data-Hiding

nachiket : Okay

hrily : any more questoins

anumeha29 : nopee

ckbs : no

ram_aditya : Nothing for now..

priyam : none i suppose

ishaan : no

hrily : Okay
lets pack  up
I'm too hungry now :smile:

Good night  everyone

salman-bhai : Okay so the next lecture will be taken by <@U530UCFTL>

salman-bhai : Good Night people!

ckbs : gn

anumeha29 : Good Night ! and thanks for a great session :slightly_smiling_face:

salman-bhai : Hope you guys learnt something even though it was very elementary stuff!

ram_aditya : Thanks for the session:slightly_smiling_face: 

priyam : Thank you! And yea bye!

ishaan : Good Night! :slightly_smiling_face:

ckbs : thanks for the session !
