salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> set the channel topic: Session 4 -MySQL Basics by Salman Shah

salman-bhai : <https://www.codecademy.com/articles/sql-commands>

List of SQL Commands that we'll be doing today!

salman-bhai : Also a Short Read on Popular Relational Database Management Systems that you might find useful!

<https://www.codecademy.com/articles/sql-rdbms>

salman-bhai : Hi

salman-bhai : So how many of you are ready ?

priyam : Not me but go ahead, Ill catch up in a few minutes

manish : yeah even I'll catch up

salman-bhai : Alright! We'll revise a few concepts before going ahead!

salman-bhai : <@U56JCBFA9> define a *Relational Database*

salman-bhai : I'm hoping you guys don't sleep :stuck_out_tongue: There's lots of coding in this session!

salman-bhai : <@U56JCBFA9> ????

salman-bhai : <@U55UC8R09>

salman-bhai : Kindly tell the answer!

ckbs : a relational DB stores data in the form of tables

salman-bhai : Looks like ma'am is busy at the moment

salman-bhai : Okay

ckbs : It is based on a schema - which includes the name of the table and different column names

salman-bhai : <@U56DHFD99> WOuld you kindly remind us what is a Primary Key?

salman-bhai : <@U55UC8R09> correct!

salman-bhai : <@U55UB6X9P> Kindly tell us what is a Foreign Key and the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key

rosag31 : Yeah, A primary key is a unique key which identifies an instance. It is different for different instances.

salman-bhai : Umm that is right <@U56DHFD99> but in simple terms every table in your relational database will have a column which is in most cases called ID which will uniquely identify each and every row in that table

nachiket : Foreign key is mainly used for creating/indetifying relations while primary key is used for uniquely to identify a instance

salman-bhai : We'll talk about this in a bit of detail today

rosag31 : ok:+1:

salman-bhai : <@U55UB6X9P> again correct but in simple terms foreign key is basically the primary key of any other table!

salman-bhai : No need to be so accurate on the definitions! :stuck_out_tongue:

nachiket : ok:sweat_smile:

salman-bhai : <@U55UDASSV> can we have two primary keys in a particular instance/table?

salman-bhai : <@U579Y5A7Q> can we have two or more foreign key columns in a table?

salman-bhai : <@U57A20DSS> tell me which SQL Version are you running?

anumeha29 : sorry internet connection went off

hlpr98 : yes.. since a column has many rows. i think

bhavishya : I think you can have 2 columns that uniquely identify a record. But its called an alternate key

salman-bhai : <@U55UJ9MH7> you're familiar with MySQL right?

salman-bhai : anumeha29: Chill da!

rithesh : not much

salman-bhai : Forget alternate keys just primary key. Tell if we can have two or not

bhavishya : no

salman-bhai : <@U55UDASSV> correct

salman-bhai : <@U579Y5A7Q> yes you can have primary keys of various other tables in different columns that's why multiple foregin keys can be present!

salman-bhai : All right <@U55UJ9MH7>

ishaan : mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.18, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
that is the version i have

salman-bhai : All right any doubts anyone till now?

salman-bhai : Cool cool!

anumeha29 : nope

ishaan : no

ckbs : no

nachiket : no

rosag31 : no

bhavishya : no

salman-bhai : Okay so this is how it's going to work! I'm going to put up a code snippet and you have to copy paste it as it is on the PHPMyAdmin Console! Then I'll explain what that code snippet does!

salman-bhai : Now on the left column there is a New option

salman-bhai : I want you guys to create a new database called dbms-cc! After you've done that, put up a thumbs up on this statement!

anumeha29 : :+1:

salman-bhai : anumeha29: Not like that! :stuck_out_tongue:

salman-bhai : Any problems ?

anumeha29 : oh sorry didnt see that it was to that statement :stuck_out_tongue:

hlpr98 : whats the "new option" ?

salman-bhai : ON the left sidebar there's a "New" text href

salman-bhai : CLick on that and create a new database called 'dbms-cc'

salman-bhai : If you don't know where to click send a screenshot! :smile:

hrily : If you can't find it
Just go to Database tab
You can create one there

salman-bhai : <@U530UCFTL> Good morning sir!

salman-bhai : That as well!

salman-bhai : Guys please respond!

ckbs : salman-bhai: I am getting access denied for the phpmyadmin page ! I will try to figure it out

salman-bhai : What username and password are you putting?

salman-bhai : Username is root

nachiket : salman-bhai:  I am getting error too...400 Bad request

salman-bhai : And password is the one you put during installation.

salman-bhai : installation**

salman-bhai : <@U55UB6X9P> screenshot please!

ckbs : yes, it worked now !

salman-bhai : Please put username as *root*!

salman-bhai : And password is whatever you put up during installation!

salman-bhai : Any other problems please send up!

nachiket : <@U55UB6X9P|nachiket> shared a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/nachiket/F5JSQPC3C/screenshot_from_2017-05-27_11-29-20.png|Screenshot from 2017-05-27 11-29-20.png>

salman-bhai : Restart the server and put localhost/phpmyadmin

hlpr98 : :+1:

nachiket : salman-bhai: It worked..Thanks

salman-bhai : Np

salman-bhai : Alright moving ahead

salman-bhai : If you have doubts please ping in the other group from now!

salman-bhai : Don't want to make logs messy for everyone!

salman-bhai : Now click on your table

salman-bhai : ANd you'll see a COnsole icon at the bottom

salman-bhai : Click on it and type the following command!

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F5KM0B1V4/-.php|Untitled> and commented: This command creates a new table for us. It allows you to to put in columns of your choice!

salman-bhai : <@U56DHFD99> can you identify the primary key in this table?

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F5KM0JFRC/how_to_insert_values_in_the_table.php|How to insert values in the table> and commented: Copy paste this command and after understanding what it does add your own name to it as well.

rosag31 : is the primary key id?

salman-bhai : Yup we've created that column for that sole purpose

salman-bhai : Every row in that column will have a unique value

salman-bhai : However the same cannot be said for name and age!

salman-bhai : People who are lagging behind please comment what the Issue is

ishaan : salman-bhai: I have internet problem.. I'm using slack on my phone right now and I'm trying to get the internet working on my laptop

salman-bhai : OKay

salman-bhai : Alright so moving ahead!

salman-bhai : The INSERT INTO function allows you to add row values to your table

salman-bhai : It's combined with the VALUES commnad

salman-bhai : Any doubts?

anumeha29 : no

ckbs : no

rosag31 : Nope

nachiket : no

kenichi : No

hlpr98 : no

ishaan : no

bhavishya : no

priyam : no

salman-bhai : OKay so from now I'll just directly add commands over here and explain what they mean! In case they don't work ping me

salman-bhai : Otherwise I'll assume you got it!

salman-bhai : Cool?

anumeha29 : ok

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F5KMLGEF9/-.m|Untitled> and commented: <@U56JCBFA9> run this command and tell me what output you get and what this command does

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F5JA3EXMF/-.m|Untitled> and commented: <@U56DHFD99> run this and tell us what you think it's function is!

anumeha29 : there was no output :confused: ..it just shows the table student

anumeha29 : the one i created

salman-bhai : <@U56JCBFA9> did you add a row to your table called *students*?

anumeha29 : yeah

anumeha29 : it shows id , name age

salman-bhai : INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) 
VALUES (1, 'Salman Shah', 18);
SELECT * FROM students;

anumeha29 : and my details in it

salman-bhai : Run this

anumeha29 : yeah yeah

anumeha29 : did that

salman-bhai : Haan ji!

salman-bhai : SO basically what *SELECT* does is it select a particular column in the table specified and returns all the values in that column

rosag31 : it says one row affected

anumeha29 : oh okay

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F5KMLRFAT/-.txt|Untitled> and commented: <@U57A20DSS> run this and tell me what output you get?

salman-bhai : <@U56DHFD99> now run the SELECT command and see if you're changes are affected or not

salman-bhai : @others please run these commands as well! WIll give you an idea of how things are working!

salman-bhai : <@U56DHFD99> any doubts?

salman-bhai : <@U57A20DSS> any doubts?

ishaan : salman-bhai: sorry.. net isn't working yet :(

salman-bhai : <@U55UDASSV> what output did you get?

salman-bhai : Cool cool

bhavishya : it displays only the id field

priyam : :+1:

rosag31 : and the age gets modified to 17

salman-bhai : Awesome! <@U55UDASSV> <@U56DHFD99>

salman-bhai : SO basically we've learnt four commands now
*CREATE TABLE*
*INSERT INTO*
*SELECT*
*UPDATE*

salman-bhai : Everyone with me here till now?

salman-bhai : Awesome!

salman-bhai : Now last two commands

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F5KM2DLPQ/add_a_column_in_the_existing_table.pl|Add a column in the existing table> and commented: If no doubts in this put up a thumbs up

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F5J75JMR6/after_that_run_this_command_to_update_a_value_in_the_table.m|After that run this command to update a value in the table> and commented: Put thumbs up if no doubts

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F5JU8ADUL/this_deletes_all_those_rows_which_are_empty_for_the_college_field_.c|This deletes all those rows which are empty for the college field!> and commented: Put up thumbs up if no doubts

salman-bhai : Another thing is that the keyword *WHERE* is basically the conditional statement here!

salman-bhai : So all conditions are added after the WHERE statement

salman-bhai : <@U56H3SYJG> can you tell me what is NULL over here?

kenichi : Where we did not update the value of the field college

salman-bhai : @all has anyone heard  of REGEX?

salman-bhai : <@U56H3SYJG> yes basically it's the default value that is assigned by MySQL to a particular column value

salman-bhai : Or pattern - matching

ckbs : yes

salman-bhai : OKay tell us about it?

anumeha29 : regular expressions ?

salman-bhai : Yes!

salman-bhai : <@U56JCBFA9>

ckbs : using LIKE command, we can find rows where certain pattern is observed ?

salman-bhai : Exactly!

salman-bhai : So now after basic SQL Commands let's move to queires!

salman-bhai : queries**

salman-bhai : 1. LIKE and BETWEEN

anumeha29 : an object used for search or replace functions ?

salman-bhai : In the WHERE CLAUSE you can use LIKE to match a particular value!

salman-bhai : Primarily SEARCH

salman-bhai : I want you guys to insert a minimum of 5 random values to your table

anumeha29 : oh okayy

salman-bhai : The students table that is!

ckbs : salman-bhai: Yes, it showed all the names which contained that sub string

bhavishya : Is % a wildcard for multiple characters?

salman-bhai : Yes!

bhavishya : okay!

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F5JA63T2M/between_keyword_used_in_where_clause.m|BETWEEN keyword used in WHERE clause>

salman-bhai : Please put up Thumbs Up next to code snippets after you've run them!

salman-bhai : OKay so similarly you can have AND and OR conditions after the where conditions

salman-bhai : FOr example this

salman-bhai : <@U52A977UG|salman-bhai> uploaded a file: <https://compsocnitk.slack.com/files/salman-bhai/F5KM4N3GW/-.m|Untitled>

salman-bhai : Again thumbs up if you got it!

salman-bhai : Alright that's it for today!

salman-bhai : Sorry guys it got a bit messed up in the beginning!

salman-bhai : Do you think I should Live Stream on YouTube while running these commands or how it's happening currently is fine enough?

anumeha29 : its fine this way

priyam : This is fine

ishaan : this is fine

nachiket : Yeah fine this way..

ckbs : I think live streaming would be better ... because I got confused only in the initial step of navigating to phpmyadmin page.....but the rest of the commands were clear

hlpr98 : this is fine

bhavishya : its fine

salman-bhai : Alright majority wins! Sorry <@U55UC8R09> !

salman-bhai : <@U55UC8R09> You won't have to set it up again!

bhavishya : Like 11

priyam : Yes can we have earlier

salman-bhai : We'll do remaining MySQL Syntax and then talk about how to set up the project and get started on it

salman-bhai : How earlier?

salman-bhai : It'll be a two hour session mostly!

salman-bhai : Hopefully we'll be faster than today and cover much more now that we have a method in place!

anumeha29 : 8 :see_no_evil: ?

bhavishya : Yeah 8 works for me

priyam : Yes, does 8 sound fine?

salman-bhai : I'll take an hour for MySQL Syntax and then project environment setup! That might take some time
