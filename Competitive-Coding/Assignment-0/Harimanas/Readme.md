1. TEST
    LOGIC: Takes Input from the screen and stores it in 'i'.If the value of 'i' is 42,the loop breaks or else it prints the value stored in 'i'.
2. HS08TEST
    LOGIC: Checks whether the given amount of withdrawal 'w' is a multiple of 5.If 'w' is not a multiple of 5,it prints the initial amount 'a' upto
                 2 decimal places.If it is a multiple then it checks whether the sum of 'w' and transaction charges 0.5 is greater than 'a'.
                 If the sum is greater,it prints 'a' upto 2 decimal places or else it will print the remaining balance i.e,"a-w-0.5" upto 2 decimal places .
3. FCTRL
    LOGIC: The number of trailing zeros is the power of 5 in its prime factorization.In the program ,the input is taken 't' times and it computes 
                 'k' which is the power of 5 which computes number of times the loop runs.The sum of all the integral parts are stored in 'sum' which
                 is the desired output.
4.TRICOIN
    LOGIC: The program takes input 'n', 't' times.It computes 'r' which is the square root of '2*n'.It computes the value of 'i' which satisfies the                  inequality  "i*(i+1)/2<=n".
5.SMPAIR
   LOGIC:  The program takes input 't' times and sorts the given array and returns the sum of the first two elements of the sorted array.
