## TEST
An infinite loop accepts one number at a time(n) and prints it, except when the number is 42. If the number is 42, the loop breaks and the program ends.

## HS08TEST
The program accepts the total amount in the account(b) and the amount to be withdrawn(t). It checks if the balance (b) is more than t + 0.5. If the there is enough balance, the transaction is made and b-(t+0.5) is printed and if not, the the original balance b is printed

## FCTRL
The number of trailing zeros in a factorial is the power of 5 in it's prime factorization. The program accepts the number of test cases. For each test, the number is divided by powers of 5 to calculate the index of 5 in the prime factorization, which is the number of trailing zeros in n!

## TRICOIN
For each test case, i keeps track of the number of coins in each level of the triangle, and count keeps track of the level, until n is exhausted. 

## SMPAIR
For each test case the input array is sorted and and the sum of the first two elements(form the smallest pair) is printed.
