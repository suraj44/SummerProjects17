                                                                               Assignment-1
1.TSORT
   LOGIC: The program sorts the given array using merge sort algorithm.It takes a recursive approach to divide the array and merges 
                the sorted counterparts and finally returns a single array.
2.MAXDIFF
   LOGIC:The program takes 't' test cases.For each case,the given array of 'n' elements is sorted.Given  'k', if 'k' is less than or equal
               to 'n/2'  then  'sum1' is computed from the first 'k' terms and 'sum2' from the remaining elements of the array and the program returns 
	the absolute value of the difference between sum2 and sum1.If 'k' is greater than 'n/2' then the sorted array is reversed and the same is computed.
3.DIVGOLD
   LOGIC: The program accepts the input string.Each character of the string is erased and inserted in all possible positions of the string using
                 'erase' and 'insert' function of c++.The lexicographically minimum string is found using the 'min' function and stored in 'small'.
