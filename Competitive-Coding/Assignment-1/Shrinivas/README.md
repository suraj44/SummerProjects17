# MAXDIFF.cpp :
      In this program 't' is used to hold no. of test cases, 'n' for no. of items, and 'k'represents no. of items in one group. Here the array is sorted in decreasing order. From  starting upto 'k' and from the 'k' till last sum of weight is calculated and their difference is printed.
  
# TSORT.cpp :
      Here 'a' is the pointer array,which contains '-1' in all its variables.for each entry of number 'num',the no. containig 'num' as index is increased by 1.By using for loop all the indexes 'j' were  printed for corresponding a[j] times.
 
# DIVGOLD :
      Here 'T' is used to hold no. of test cases,actual string is stored in string 's',except one character all the characters are stored in 'temp',then using for loop,string 'temp' is checked for alphabetical order with the chosen character 's[j]', and then it is appended to string 'str',only if condition remained true. then min of actual string and 'str' is found and printed.
