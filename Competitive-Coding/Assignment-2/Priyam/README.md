# Assignment 1

## ADJLIST
An adjacency list being implemented using two classes Vertex and Graph. The vertex class stores name and neighbor info while Graph stores the vertices.

## ADJMAT
An adjacency matrix implemented using vertex and graph classes. Nearly same as previous problem with the added weight(of 1) in the form of a matrix.


## DFS
Implements Depth First Search by starting at the root and continues as far along each branch before it back tracks.


## BFS
Implements Breadth First Search by starting at the root and transverses the neigbors first before moving to the next level neighbors.
