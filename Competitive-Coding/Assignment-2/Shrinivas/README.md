# ADJMAT.cpp :
      Here one 2D array 'a[][]' is initialised to represent a graph. Element a[b][c] and a[c][b] are set to 1 if vertex 'b' is connected to vertex 'c'(vice versa).

# ADJLIST.cpp :
      Here one array of vectors a[] reresents the graph. Vector a[i] gives the vertices connected to 'i' in the graph.

# BFS.cpp :
      Here the graph is traversed so that the neighbours of the current vertex are visited before moving deeper in the graph. This is implemented using a queue.

# DFS.cpp :
      Here The graph is traversed so that the neighbours of the current vertex are visited after recursively visiting all the other routes in the graph. This is implemented using a stack.
