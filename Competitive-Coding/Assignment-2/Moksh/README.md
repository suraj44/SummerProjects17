# Assignment 2
* All the programs assume the inputs are natural numbers only(1, 2, 3 ..)

## ADJMAT
A 2D array is initialised to represent the graph. Element (i, j) of the array is set to one if vertex i is connected to vertex j. 

## ADJLIST
An array of vectors represents the graph. Vector i of the list contains the vertices connected to vertex i in the graph.

## BFS
The graph is traversed so that the neighbours of the current vertex are visited before moving deeper in the graph. This is implemented using a queue. 

## DFS
The graph is traversed so that the neighbours of the current vertex are visited after recursively exhusting all the other routes in the graph. This is implemented using a stack.
