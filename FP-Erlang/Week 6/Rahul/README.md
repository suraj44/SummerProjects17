# Assignment 5

### Given module contains the following functions - 

add/1 - Curried implementation of addition.

add/2 - Implements the standard addition using the curried version of the function.

subtract/1 - Curried implementation of subtraction.

subtract/2 -  - Implements the standard subtraction using the curried version of the function.

multiply/1 - Curried implementation of multiplication.

multiply/2 - Implements the standard multiplication using the curried version of the function.

divide/1 - Curried implementation of division.

divide/2 - Implements the standard division using the curried version of the function.

isremdr/1 - Checks if a number Y divides X (Curried implementation).

isremdr/2 - Checks if a number Y divides X using the curried version of the same function.

greaterThanX/1 - Checks if a number Y is greater than X (Curried implementation).

greaterThanX/2 - Checks if a number Y is greater than X using the curried version of the same function.

lessThanX/1 - Checks if a number Y is less than X (Curried implementation).

lessThanX/2 - Checks if a number Y is less than X  using the curried version of the same function.

fact/1 - Computes the factorial of a number.

derive/2 - Computes the derivative of a function F at a given value X and H.

integral/4 - COmputes the definite integral of a function F at a given value of A, B and N.

foldl/3 - Processes elements of a list starting from the left.

foldr/3 - Processes elements of a list starting from the right.

map/2 - Applies a given function to each element of a list, returning a list of elements in the same order.

filterl/2 - Filters the elements of a list that satisfy a predicate starting from the left.

foldl2/3 - foldl implementation using foldr.

### Examples of curried functions in higher order functions - 

lessthanList/2 - Filters a given list less than a given number X (filter).

sumList/1 - Computes the sum of all elements of a list (fold).

squareList/1 - Computes the square of each element and outputs a new list (map).

evenList/1 - Filters a given list by retaining only the even numbers (filter).

factList/1 - Computes the factorial of eac element and outputs a new list (map).
