1. Various ciphers are:
   a) Atbash Cipher:
      A cipher where 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y' and so on.
   a) Ceasar Cipher:
      In Ceasar Cipher, every alphabet is shifted by a particular fixed value. Example: secret will be written as tfdsfu when shifted by one    	place.
   b) Vigenere Cipher:
      It combines multiple Ceasar Ciphers. It contains an encryption key, which determines how much an alphabet is shifted.
   c) Playfair Cipher:
      It uses a 5 X 5 grid to encrypt and decrypt messages. A known sequence of alphabets is arragned in the grid, with duplicates removed. 
      Remaining spaces are filled with unused alphabets in alphabetical order.
   d) Trifid Cipher:
      It uses a cube of side 3 instead of a 5x5 grid.

2. Ciphers fail due to frequency analysis of the characters in the encrypted message. With increasing computation power, it becomes increasingly easier to brute force and decrypt the message.
