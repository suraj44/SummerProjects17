Domain Name System (DNS) is the system which is responsible for assigning the domain names to the IP addresses.
The domain names will be usually memorizable for the users to understand . But these names have to be converted 
into IP addresses in order for the computers to accesss them. 
 	DNS servers stores these IP addresses and the corresponding domain names of that address.
When a particular domain is accessed these DNS servers converts the domain name into the IP address which enables
the computers to access that particular domain.
