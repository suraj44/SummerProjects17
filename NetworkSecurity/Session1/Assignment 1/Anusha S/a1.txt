What is DNS? What are DNS servers?

DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is part of the application layer of the TCP/IP reference model.
It provides a way to convert human-readable website names (domain names) into computer-readable numerical IP addresses, 
and hence is called the Internet's phone book.

DNS is implemented using two software components: the DNS server and the DNS client (or resolver). 

A DNS server hosts the information that enables client computers to resolve DNS names to the IP addresses 
that computers use to communicate with each other.
Basically it matches domain name to its associated IP address.
