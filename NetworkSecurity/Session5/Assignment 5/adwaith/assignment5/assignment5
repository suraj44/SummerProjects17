1.Taking a look at the screenshot "sshot1.png",The machine 172.16.0.107 is getting IP addresses of the different services provided by google.There is much more services than what is seen on the screen shot.

2.By adding the filter "ip.addr=74.125.95.147"   ,We come to know that machine 172.16.0.107 is sending huge number of packets to 74.125.95.147 --one of the IP addresses of google.  --screenshot:  tcp_packets.png 

3.By adding the filter dnsserver,We come to know that machine 172.17.0.107 has sent huge number of DNS queries to get tha IP addresses of google servers of different services.screenshot:  dnsserver.png

4.From the endpoints.png ,the fact that 172.16.0.107 is the highest traffic creator is proved.
