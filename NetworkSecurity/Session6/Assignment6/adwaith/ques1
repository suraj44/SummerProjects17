The exdcutable 1 could be this:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int a;
	printf("\nEnter an integer");
	scanf("%d",&a);
	
	printf("\nTry again");
	return 0;
}



Explanation:
	
	--In this executable,it is just taking an integer and printing the string "Try again" .
	--This conclusion was made when the entered integer was not compared with any other integer(no cmp) .
	--There was no unconditional jump or anything as in executable 2.
	
	--So there is no way to win.
