Write about subnet masks and the process of NAT.

A Subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address, and divides the IP address into network address and host address.
Subnetting an IP network is to separate a big network into smaller multiple networks for reorganization and security purposes.

The bits of the subnet mask are defined as follows:
   All bits that correspond to the network ID are set to 1.
   All bits that correspond to the host ID are set to 0.


Network address translation (NAT) provides a method for translating the IPv4 addresses of computers on one network 
into IPv4 addresses of computers on a different network. 

NAT technology was developed to provide a temporary solution to the IPv4 address-depletion problem. 

NAT technology lets computers on any network use reusable private addresses to connect to computers with globally unique public addresses on the Internet.
